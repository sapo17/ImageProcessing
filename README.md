# ImageProcessing

You can either simply clone or download this repository. 

All the necesarry code can be found at edge_detection.ipynb.
To execute this file, you need Python 3.7 and Jupyter Notebook. My recommandation for both of them would be using Anaconda ( https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual ). Simply follow the mentioned steps and you will be good to go.

If you have no prior experience to python or jupyter notebook, here are some good links to learn the basics.

I've put the classic lena image in the repository, you can simply add your own images to try out the algorithms. Simply put your image on your working directory and import the image the 'lena' image. Please don't forget to work with the monochrome version of your image, otherwise the execution time would be unbearable.
